# Java Learning Repository

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository is structured to reflect the key topics I'm studying as I delve deeper into Java programming. I'll continue adding more topics and examples as I learn.

## Folder Structure

### 1. [Basics](./basics)
   - Introduction to Java syntax, data types, and basic operations.

### 2. [Decision Structure](./decision_structure)
   - Covers conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch` for making decisions in code.

### 3. [Loops](./loops)
   - Learn about looping structures such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for iterative operations.

### 4. [Methods](./methods)
   - Understand how to define and use methods, including examples like a "credit check method."

### 5. [Arrays](./arrays)
   - Learn about array declarations, operations, and applications (e.g., word count sessions).

### 6. [Objects](./objects)
   - Practice instantiating and working with objects, a core concept in object-oriented programming.

## Future Topics
- I much more as I explore the Java ecosystem!
